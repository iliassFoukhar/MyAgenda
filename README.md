This was an academic project made in 7 days when we first started learning web developement. We used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front end and PHP, MySql in The backend.
Basically the user can create an account, then the platform offers him an agenda where he has the following rights :
  - Add a post
  - Remove a post
  - Edit a post if the user is the author of the post

Also the user has the possibility to :
  - Add a friend
  - Remove a friend
  - Post in the agenda of friends
  - Edit posts written in friends' agenda
  - Remove posts written in friends' agenda
